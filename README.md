# DungeonsAndDragonsBestiaCodex
The Dungeons and Dragons: Bestia Codex , is an app that uses the awesome, D&amp;D API (http://www.dnd5eapi.co) to pull information about the monsters in the D&amp;D 5th edition game. [The UI has been designed for the iPhone X ONLY as of this time] This is part 4 of a 6 part series of apps that will use the D&amp;D API. Look forward to the others coming soon!
